# Activity Stopwatch App

The Activity Stopwatch App is a simple Python-based tool designed to help you track and analyze how you spend your time throughout the day. Whether you're logging time spent sleeping, coding, training, or any custom activity, this app provides an intuitive command-line interface to start and stop sessions, manually add past activities, and generate visual statistics about your time usage.

## Features

- **Activity Logging**: Start and stop a timer to record the duration of your activities.
- **Manual Session Addition**: Add past activity sessions using a simplified date format (e.g., 0 09:30 for today at 9:30 AM).
- **Categorization**: Organize activities with predefined categories (e.g., "Sleeping", "Coding", "Training", "Other") or create your own.
- **Statistics Generation**: View total hours spent on each activity over a specified number of days.
- **Visualization**: Generate bar and pie charts to visualize your time distribution, saved as stats.png.
- **Persistent Data**: Activity logs and custom categories are saved to files for future use.
